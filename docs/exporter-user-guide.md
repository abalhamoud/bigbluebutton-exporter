# Exporter User Guide

## Environment Variables
* API_SECRET - BigBlueButton API Secret
    * **Required: true**
    * Use `$ bbb-conf --secret` on BigBlueButton server to get secret and Base API url
* API_BASE_URL - BigBlueButton API base URL
    * **Required: true**
    * Example: "https://example.com/bigbluebutton/api/"
    * Trailing slash is required!
    * Make sure you supply the base url **of the API**, often this URL ends in `/api/`
* DEBUG - Enable debug logging
    * Required: false
    * Default: false
    * Values: &lt;true | false&gt;
* RECORDINGS_METRICS - Enable collection of recordings metrics 
    * Required: false
    * Default: true
    * Values: &lt;true | false&gt;
* BIND_IP - Which network address to bind the HTTP server of the exporter
    * Required: false
    * Default: 0.0.0.0
* PORT - HTTP port to serve the exporter metrics
    * Required: false
    * Default: 9688
    * Values: &lt;1 - 65535&gt;
* TLS_VERIFY - Enable (default) / disable TLS CA verification or replace with a custom `CA_BUNDLE` directory or file
    * Required: false
    * Default: true
    * Values: &lt;true | false | path to CA_BUNDLE directory or file &gt; 
    * A `CA_BUNDLE` file is normal file that contains a list of CA certificates you trust.
      See [FAQ](./faq.md#my-ca_bundle-for-the-tls_verify-environment-variable-is-not-working) or the under the hood 
      [library documentation](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification) for details.
* BBB_VERSION_READ_FROM_DISK - Enable the `bbb_version` metric
  * Required: false
  * Default: false
  * Values: &lt;true | false&gt;
  * Prerequisites: access to `/etc/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-release` (for Docker containers do a read-only bind mount) 
    so running the exporter remotely with this option is not possible (unless you setup a remote file mount).
  * The metric `bbb_version` relies on this option to be turned on
 
## Optimizations
* RECORDINGS_METRICS_READ_FROM_DISK - Collect expensive recordings metrics by querying the disk instead of the API.
This can substantially decrease the scrape time required for the exporter to respond to metrics requests.
    * Required: false
    * Default: false
    * Values: &lt;true | false&gt;
    * Prerequisites: access to `/var/bigbluebutton` (for Docker containers do a read-only bind mount) so running the
    exporter remotely with this option is not possible (unless you setup a remote file mount).
    * The metric `bbb_recordings_unprocessed` relies on the optimization to be turned on since the information is not 
    exposed via the BigBlueButton XML API
    
### Metric Histogram Custom Buckets
* ROOM_PARTICIPANTS_CUSTOM_BUCKETS - Custom bucket sizes for the `bbb_room_participants_bucket` histogram metric
    * Required: false
    * Default: `0,1,5,15,30,60,90,120,150,200,250,300,400,500`
    * `INF` will be added automatically as the final bucket size
    * Values: list of integers separated using comma (`,`)
    
* ROOM_LISTENERS_CUSTOM_BUCKETS - Custom bucket sizes for the `bbb_room_listeners_bucket` histogram metric
    * Required: false
    * Default: `0,1,5,15,30,60,90,120,150,200,250,300,400,500`
    * `INF` will be added automatically as the final bucket size
    * Values: list of integers separated using comma (`,`)
* ROOM_VOICE_PARTICIPANTS_CUSTOM_BUCKETS - Custom bucket sizes for the `bbb_room_voice_participants_bucket` histogram 
metric
    * Required: false
    * Default: `0,1,5,15,30,60,90,120`
    * `INF` will be added automatically as the final bucket size
    * Values: list of integers separated using comma (`,`)
* ROOM_VIDEO_PARTICIPANTS_CUSTOM_BUCKETS - Custom bucket sizes for the `bbb_room_video_participants_bucket` histogram 
metric
    * Required: false
    * Default: `0,1,5,15,30,60,90,120`
    * `INF` will be added automatically as the final bucket size
    * Values: list of integers separated using comma (`,`)
    
## Metrics
### Gauges
* bbb_meetings_participants - Total number of participants in all BigBlueButton meetings
* bbb_meetings_listeners - Total number of listeners in all BigBlueButton meetings
* bbb_meetings_voice_participants - Total number of voice participants in all BigBlueButton meetings
* bbb_meetings_video_participants - Total number of video participants in all BigBlueButton meetings
* bbb_meetings_participant_clients(type=<client\>) - Total number of participants in all BigBlueButton meetings by 
  client (html5|dial-in|flash)
* bbb_meetings_participants_origin(name=<origin\>, server=<servername\>) - Total number of participants in all 
  BigBlueButton meetings by server name and origin metadata (v0.6.0+)

    !!! hint
        *bbb_meetings_participants_origin* is useful when using multiple Greenlight instances with a single 
        BigBlueButton server, or adding custom bbb-origin-server-name or bbb-origin metadata tags in your BigBlueButton
        application. See [PR #65](https://github.com/greenstatic/bigbluebutton-exporter/pull/65) for details.

* bbb_recordings_unprocessed - Total number of BigBlueButton recordings that are enqueued to be processed, requires for 
the exporter to be installed on the BigBlueButton server (access to `/var/bigbluebutton/` dir) and for 
`RECORDINGS_METRICS_READ_FROM_DISK` to be enabled
* bbb_api_up - 1 if BigBlueButton API is responding 0 otherwise
* bbb_exporter(labels: version) - Information about the exporter (i.e. version)
* bbb_version(labels: version) - BigBlueButton version, requires for `BBB_VERSION_READ_FROM_DISK` to be enabled
